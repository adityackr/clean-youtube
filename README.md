# Clean Youtube Project

## Overview

When we watch a playlist in youtube, we often distracted by other recommended videos. This application helps us to not distract by any other videos. We just paste the link. And we watch the playlist without distracting. This app will noy show any recommended videos or any ad. We watch the playlist as if we watched in a course site video player.
